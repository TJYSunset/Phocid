A modern offline music player with familiar designs for Android 11+.

This project aims to be a replacement with personal tweaks for the now-defunct https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph[Phonograph] music player, but has no connections with it.

== Help & FAQ

Please refer to https://sunsetware.org/phocid/help/[the help page on the website.]

If your problem is not covered by this page, you can create an https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid/issues[issue] or https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid/discussions[discussion] depending on the severity.

== Features

* Familiar user experience
* Better metadata support; Namely, multiple artists.
* Better sorting when your music library differs from your system language
* Regex-based blocklist
* Playback speed and pitch control
* More lyrics styles
* Optional less-vibrant colors
* Brand new design based on Material Design 3

== Missing features that are intentionally left out

* Tag editing
+
The scene of audio file tagging is a disaster.
The best metadata support library I could find is still buggy; I recommend using well-known dedicated software for this task.
* Deleting files
* Anything that requires an internet connection
* Lock screen
* Playback statistics

== Building

Remember to clone the submodule with `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

== Contributing

Please ask first if you want to work on big code changes.
Instead of directly contributing code to Phocid, it would be great if you can help with big upstream issues first, like https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/81. (Please let me know if you have successfully closed those!)
